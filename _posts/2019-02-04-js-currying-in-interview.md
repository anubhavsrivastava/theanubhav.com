### Problem 1 Add(2)(3)

If you are already familiar with this question and understand how can one solve this JavaScript tricky riddle (Yes, riddle, I don't see a use case in production code, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ), you can move on to [next section](#problem-a1--a2--a3-strict-comparison) which is an attempt to solve the extension of it (with strict equality).
There is also a [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7r0i00/can_a_1_a_2_a3_ever_evaluate_to_true/) discussion around this problem. Most interesting comment which I noticed is,

<strong>"If this is the type of code I'm likely to encounter in your codebase, then I'm out".</strong>
