### First, What is this Technical Debt?

There may be multiple ways to define this jargon, to simple put it, `Technical debt`, in terms of software development, is implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution rather than a known better approach/solution that would take longer time to implement. Sometimes this so called short cut, is either due to lack of time, lack of resource, urgency of cause, or simply monetary. Although it is not always avoidable but should be taken into account before moving ahead with development. As the articles title says, "don't delay" rather than "don't keep" technical debt.
